SUMMARY:
This repository contains the files that are necessary for setting up a genproducitons directory that can be used to produce EFT gridpacks

INSTRUCTIONS: 
    * Run setup_production.sh
        - This script will checkout cms-sw/genproductions
        - Two of the files in cms-sw/genproductions are overwritten with the modified versions located in mcgeneration
        - Additional files from mcgeneration are copied to genproductions as well
        - The script will move you to genproductions directory it created
    * To make gridpacks
        - From genproductions, cd into bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO
        - Open configure_gridpack.py and modify according to the type of gridpack or gridpacks you would like to produce 
        - Run configure_gridpack.py

NOTES:
    * If you are running the script from anywhere besides cmsconnect, the script will create the genproductions directory in the same directory that GridpackGeneration is located in
    * If you are running the script from cmsconnect, it will create the directory in your /local-scratch area
    * Files in /local-scratch are deleted 30 days after their last modification, so if you would like to keep your gridpacks, be sure to move them to a permanent location after they are completed
